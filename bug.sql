The following SQL query attempts to update a column named 'salary' in the 'employees' table, but the column name is misspelled as 'salery'. This will result in a syntax error because the database cannot find a column with that name.
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salery = salery * 1.10
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
